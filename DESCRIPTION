Description: CohortMethod is an R package for performing new-user cohort studies
    in an observational database in the OMOP Common Data Model. It extracts the
    necessary data from a database and uses a large set of covariates for both the 
    propensity and outcome model, including for example all drugs, diagnoses, procedures, 
    as well as age, comorbidity indexes, etc. Large scale regularized regression is used to 
    fit the propensity and outcome models. Functions are included for trimming, stratifying, 
    (varibale and fixed ratio) matching and weighting by propensity scores, as well as 
    diagnostic functions, such as propensity score distribution plots and plots showing 
    covariate balance before and after matching and/or trimming. Supported outcome models 
    are (conditional) logistic regression, (conditional) Poisson regression, and 
    (stratified) Cox regression. Also included are Kaplan-Meier plots that can adjust for 
    the stratification or matching.
